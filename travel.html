		<h1>Location</h1>
		<p>ISRE 2017 will take place in St. Louis, Missouri, USA. St. Louis is a thriving metropolitan area filled with cultural riches to explore.  The city was a transportation hub in the days of the railroad and Mississippi riverboats, and was considered the “Gateway to the West” as the starting point for wagons on the Oregon Trail.  The conference will be held in the city’s Central West End, which has a European feel with small walkable streets and large sidewalks full of outdoor dining.  Eateries feature upscale, local, and ethnic cuisine.</p>

		<h2>Conference Venue</h2>
		<div class = "row">
			<div class = "seven columns">
			<p><strong>Our venue will be the famed <a href = "http://www.chaseparkplaza.com">Chase Park Plaza</a></strong>, which often ranks as one of the best hotels in the US due to its luxurious renovation that preserves historical details of the landmark property.  Washington University in St. Louis is a top school in the US and a generous supporter of the ISRE conference.  St. Louis has easy flight connections across the US and to major airline hubs overseas.</p>
