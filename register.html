		<h1>Registration Information</h1>
		<p>Registration includes admission to program sessions, the conference package (conference documentation, badge, program booklet, etc.), coffee breaks, two receptions with hors d'ouevres and a drink, and the conference banquet.</p> 
		
		<p>A discounted registration fee is available to members of the International Society for Research on Emotion. Those who are not yet members may <a href = "http://www.isre.org/membership.php">apply for membership</a>. Those who are applying for membership may register at the members rate before their membership is approved.</p>

		<p>Online registration is available until July 10 (early bird registration until June 1). On-site registration will be available July 27 (17:30 - 20:30) and July 28 (8:00-10:30) and will require payment by cash in US dollars or by credit card.</p>
		
		<p>To register, complete the form below. Please direct questions about online registration to Josh Wondra at <a href = "mailto:jdwondra@umich.edu">jdwondra@umich.edu</a>.</p>
		
		<p>Please support ISRE by staying in the conference hotel, the Chase Park Plaza.  The society will pay a fine if we do not have a certain number of rooms, and we appreciate your consideration when you make your choice of accommodation. See the <a href="http://isre2017.org/travel.html">Travel/Accomodations</a> page for details and the conference rate.</p>

		<p>As a special gesture of support to our early-stage members, we are offering FREE CONFERENCE REGISTRATION to DOCTORAL STUDENTS and POST-DOCTORAL RESEARCHERS who stay at least 3 nights in their own room at the Chase Park Plaza.  If two students/postdocs share a room for at least 4 nights, they will both receive free registration.  Note that the Chase is a luxury hotel, but the special rates are affordable, especially for those sharing a room.  You can request a double room, and roll-away beds can be added to a room at no charge. </p>

		<p>To facilitate room shares for all attendees, we have established <a href = "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ecdgiqBzgQU59PWWFMRLUYT4yVtwuAf0WzjXZf51jro/edit?usp=sharing">a page for individuals to find others who are interested in sharing.</a></p>
